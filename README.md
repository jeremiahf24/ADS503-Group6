## Mission
Stroke Sentry Solutions is dedicated to addressing the global health crisis of stroke, the **second leading cause of death worldwide** according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 

## Overview
Stroke mortality rates could exceed the current estimate of **11%** without early intervention. To combat this, our goal is to develop a **predictive model** using our dataset to identify high-risk individuals.

## Approach
Our methodology includes:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducting comprehensive analyses to uncover critical insights from the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Selecting relevant features to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Construction & Evaluation**: Building and assessing multiple models to determine the most effective one for stroke risk classification.

## Impact
Through early detection, we aim to significantly reduce stroke-related mortality and improve overall health outcomes.
